# Traffic-Joint-Simulator
Multithreaded joint simulation for the Parallel &amp; Concurrent Programming 

## Requirement:

In this simulation the cars come from all four directions and have the following options: to move to the left, to go forward or to cross to the right. On average, 70% of the cars will opt for a forward move, 10% will turn right and 20% left. Each vehicle moves at a constant speed during the simulation. Movement will be done with a set of predefined rules, and the problem will be solved by a cellular automated approach.
